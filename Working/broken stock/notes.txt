Is Pit working directory selected?
Working directory should be structured as follows:

"
Pit
  /Current_Pit
    currentpit_###.str/dtm
  /Blasting
    /RLs
      RLs_all_solid.str/dtm
  /Broken Stocks
"

### to be replaced with the pit identifier "GW, TW, ERL"
RLs to be replaced with blast toe RL.

Report to output RLs files with user provided date and RL inside "broken stock" folder

Group geomatically with the solid (same solid as RLs_all_solid)

THINGS TO WORK OUT
- If you can have solids overlapping (else this will require lots of cleanup on blast reporting)
- Block model report format that suits that outputs required (could have it set up to copy paste straight into excel)
- CSV is probably going to be the best format file to use



OUTPUT NOTES
Volume of 435 shots using object report: 145,740
Volume of 435 shots using block model report: 142,500
2.3% variance
